Lghtweight APIs with harvester.js
==========
Or *how I learned to stop worrying and love Node.js APIs*

Who am I?
---------
A nerd, working at UniRitter and AGCO.

And what is this AGCO thing?
-------------------------------
* We build tractors, sprayers, harvesters (nudge, nudge) and other machinery
* We build the tech to connect them all
* And this is pretty high-tech stuff

Core beliefs
------------
* distributed over centralized
* just enough over overengineering
* gradual evolution over big bangs
* simple over easy

Inspiration
-----------
* Agile manifesto
* 12-factor apps
* Reactive manifesto

Core practices
--------------
* emerging architecture:
	- YAGNI & DRY 
	- point-to-point integration
	- lightweight APIs
* and our personal favorite: no bikeshedding
 
On bikeshedding
---------------
![It might be easier to get approal on the construction of a $1 Billion reactor, due to its complexity...](images/bikeshedding00.png "Reactors are easy to discuss")
 
On bikeshedding
---------------
![...than getting approval on a $ 100 bike shed improvement, due to its triviality](images/bikeshedding01.png "Now bikesheds, these are hard")

In comes JSONAPI

And there's more...
